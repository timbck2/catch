**[Catch](http://www.giorgiocalderolla.com/index.html#catch)** is a Mac OS X application that runs in the menubar, and will automatically download any new torrent files in your **[ShowRSS](http://showrss.karmorra.info/)** feed to a folder you can choose, optionally opening them in your favorite BitTorrent client. You will never miss an episode again :)

It's *free*, and open source.
